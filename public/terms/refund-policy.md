# Refund Policy for Maker's Ledger

**Last Updated:** July 15, 2025

This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which refunds are provided for our subscription-based service ("Service"). By subscribing to Maker's Ledger, you agree to this Refund Policy and our Terms of Service.

### 1. General Policy

Due to the nature of our digital service, we have a **no-refund policy** for our monthly subscription fees once a billing cycle has commenced. When you subscribe, you are paying for access to the Service for the upcoming month, and this access is granted immediately.

### 2. Monthly Subscriptions

* **No Refunds for Partial Months:** We do not offer prorated refunds or credits for any partial month's service or for periods where your account was not used.
* **Cancellation:** If you choose to cancel your subscription, your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. You will continue to have access to the Service until that date, and you will not be charged for the next billing cycle.

### 3. Your Statutory Rights (14-Day Cooling-Off Period)

Under Irish and EU law, consumers typically have a 14-day "cooling-off" period to withdraw from a contract for digital services.

However, this right of withdrawal is waived if you consent to the immediate performance of the contract (i.e., getting immediate access to the Service) and acknowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal as a result.

**By subscribing to Maker's Ledger and accessing the Service, you explicitly agree to the immediate provision of the service and acknowledge that you thereby waive your statutory 14-day right of withdrawal for a refund.**

### 4. Exceptions

We believe in being fair and may consider providing a refund, in our sole discretion, under the following specific circumstances:

* **Billing Errors:** If you have been charged incorrectly due to a technical error on our part.
* **Significant Service Unavailability:** If the Service was completely unavailable or unusable for a prolonged period within a billing cycle due to a fault directly attributable to Maker's Ledger (not including scheduled maintenance for which we have provided notice).

Refund requests under these exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### 5. How to Discuss a Billing Issue or Request a Refund

If you believe you are eligible for a refund under our exceptions policy, please contact our support team within 14 days of the charge appearing on your statement.

* **Email:** kzirtm@gmail.com
* **Please include:** The email address associated with your account, the date and amount of the charge, and a clear explanation of why you are requesting a refund.

We will review all requests and communicate our decision within a reasonable timeframe.

### 6. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will apply to all subscriptions initiated after the date of the change.
