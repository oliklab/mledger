### 1. The Service

Maker's Ledger provides a web-based software-as-a-service application designed to help makers, crafters, and small business owners track raw material inventory, calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) through a recipe-based system, and analyze profitability. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
