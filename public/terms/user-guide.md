# Welcome to Maker's Ledger!

**The simple way for makers to track costs and profits.**

Hello, and welcome to your new command center! Maker's Ledger was built for one reason: to take the headache out of the most complicated part of running a craft business. We help you answer the two most important questions: "How much does it *really* cost to make my products?" and "Am I actually making a profit?"

This guide will walk you through every feature of the app. Let's get started!

---

## Part 1: Getting Started

### Signing Up
Creating your account is the first step. All you need is a valid email address. Once you sign up and confirm your email, you'll be taken to your main Dashboard.

### Your Dashboard
The Dashboard is your home base. It's designed to give you a quick overview of your business. From the main navigation, you can access the four key areas of the app:
* **Materials:** Where you manage your raw supplies.
* **Products:** Where you create recipes and see your finished goods.
* **Orders:** Where you log sales and track profits.
* **Reports:** Where you see the bigger picture of your business performance.

## Part 2: Managing Your Materials

This is the foundation of everything in Maker's Ledger. Accurately tracking your materials is the key to knowing your true costs.

### How to Add a New Raw Material
Let's say you're a candle maker and you just bought a 5-kilogram block of soy wax. Here's how you'd add it:

1.  Navigate to the **Materials** section and click the "Add New Material" button.
2.  Fill out the form:
    * **Material Name:** `Soy Wax`
    * **Purchase Quantity:** `5`
    * **Purchase Unit:** Select `kg` (kilograms) from the dropdown.
    * **Crafting Unit:** Select `g` (grams). This is the crucial step! It tells the app how you actually *use* the material in your recipes.
    * **Total Cost:** Enter the total amount you paid, for example, `€40`.
3.  Click "Save Material".

**What Happens Next? The Magic!**
Maker's Ledger automatically does the math for you. It knows that 5kg is 5000g. It then divides the total cost by the total crafting units:

`€40 / 5000g = €0.008 per gram`

This "Cost per Crafting Unit" is now stored and will be used to calculate your product costs with perfect accuracy.

### Viewing and Managing Your Inventory
In the Materials section, you'll see a list of all your supplies. This table shows you:
* The material name.
* The current stock level (in your chosen crafting unit).
* The calculated average cost per crafting unit.

From here, you can easily **edit** a material's name or units, or **delete** it entirely.

### Logging a New Supply Purchase
You've run low on Soy Wax and bought another 5kg block, but this time it cost €45. No problem!

1.  Find "Soy Wax" in your materials list.
2.  Click the "Add Stock" button.
3.  Enter the new purchase details (5kg for €45).

The app will automatically update your stock levels and, importantly, **recalculate the average cost** of your Soy Wax, ensuring your product costing remains accurate even when supplier prices change.

## Part 3: Creating Your Products & Recipes

A "Recipe" (also known as a Bill of Materials) is simply the list of ingredients you use to make one finished product.

### How to Create a Product Recipe
Let's create a recipe for a "Lavender Fields Candle".

1.  Navigate to the **Products** section and click "Create New Product".
2.  Give your product a name: `Lavender Fields Candle`.
3.  Click "Add Material to Recipe". A list of the materials from your inventory will appear.
4.  Select `Soy Wax` and enter the amount you use for one candle, for example, `200` (grams).
5.  Select `Candle Wick` and enter `1` (piece).
6.  Select `Lavender Essential Oil` and enter `10` (ml).

As you add each material, you will see the **Total Material Cost** for this product calculate in real-time. This is your **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**. Once you're done, click "Save Product".

## Part 4: Tracking Production & Sales

Now that you have materials and recipes, you can track the entire lifecycle of your products.

### Logging a Production Run
You just spent the afternoon making a batch of 10 Lavender Fields Candles.

1.  Go to the **Products** section.
2.  Find your "Lavender Fields Candle" and click "Log Production".
3.  Enter the quantity you made: `10`.

The app now does two things automatically:
1.  It deducts all the required raw materials from your **Materials Inventory** (e.g., 2000g of wax, 10 wicks, etc.).
2.  It adds `10` to your "Lavender Fields Candle" **Finished Goods Stock**.

### Logging a Sale
You sold one of your new candles at a market for €15!

1.  Navigate to the **Orders** section and click "Log New Sale".
2.  Select the "Lavender Fields Candle" from your product list.
3.  Enter the quantity sold: `1`.
4.  Enter the price you sold it for: `€15`.
5.  Click "Save Sale".

**The Profit Moment!**
The app instantly shows you the breakdown for this sale:
* **Revenue:** `€15.00`
* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** `€2.50` (or whatever the calculated recipe cost was)
* **Gross Profit:** `€12.50`

Simultaneously, the app deducts `1` from your "Lavender Fields Candle" finished goods stock. You now have a perfect, real-time view of your entire business.

## Part 5: Reports & Account Management

### Reports
The **Reports** section gives you a high-level view of your sales performance over different time periods, allowing you to track your total revenue and profitability.

### Account Management
In your account settings, you can easily:
* Change your password.
* Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription plan at any time.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **How do I handle shipping costs or packaging materials?**
    * Simply add them as a "Material"! Create a material called "Shipping Box" with a purchase unit and crafting unit of "piece". Add it to your product recipes, and its cost will be included in your COGS.
* **What if I get a discount on a bulk purchase?**
    * Just enter the final price you paid! The app calculates the average cost based on what you actually spent, so discounts are automatically factored in.
* **Is my data safe?**
    * Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption and security protocols to ensure your business data is kept safe, secure, and private.
